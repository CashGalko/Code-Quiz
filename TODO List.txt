TODO List

CSS:

1. The entire fucking style sheet. 

2. The highscores link needs to be in a nav bar on the top left of the page.
    The timer should be included in the nav bar on the top right of the page
    This will likely be done through a .a change for highscores & .timer for timer

3. Need to have a specific .hide class in css that has display:none in it to hide and show questions and answers as the quiz progresses. 

4. I need to center the questions, choices & highscore pages vert & horizontally
    Likely will need to be done with flexbox.

5. No media query is needed for this code luckily. 


Javascript:

1. add a timer
    Make sure the timer subtracts time when an incorrect answer is given
    Make sure that when the timer reaches 0 the quiz ends and take user to highscore page

2. Comparison if else statements to check whether the user has gotten the right choice or not
    If they got the right choice, give them an invisable point in the local storage
    Include a section below the choices that tells user if they got the question right or wrong. 

3. Add a highscore list that tallies score and store info in the local storage.
    Pull data from local storage to create a high score list
    Include a button that clears the local data
    Include a button that restarts the quiz

4. An onclick event for the view highscores div that takes user directly to the highscore page.



HTML:

1. Nothing that I can think of at the moment. Any changes will become apparent as I write the js / css
